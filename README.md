# TODO

- since carGurus is so good at blocking bots [and by the way is now blocking even my real human-controlled Brave browser (logged in or out) but not Firefox], get Chrome extension to upsert listings
- use Retool to create a UI that allows us to mark listings as inactive, priority, etc. Shows ratings, images, etc.

# Later

- make an API route that scrapes DuckDuckGo and Edmunds and inserts ratings for a model
- make an API route that scrapes CarGurus search results and doesn't get blocked by their bot detector
- make a cron job that calls the CarGurus scraper
- get it working on Vercel (lower priority since I could run this on my local laptop or Digital Ocean)
- use Retool to create a UI that allows blocking models
- Autotrader?
