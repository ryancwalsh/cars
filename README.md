# Goal

To buy a car that fits my needs.

## App goal

To show an updated list of nearby used car listings filtered by my requirements and sorted descending by a weighted score (determined by various factors such as 3rd party ratings).

# Architecture / Design

TODO

# Linting

TODO

# Running the local dev server

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

# TODO

- add weighted score to Retool webapp
- add screeshots of Supabase, Retool, etc to this readme

## Later

- make an API route that scrapes CarGurus search results and doesn't get blocked by their bot detector
- make a cron job that calls the CarGurus scraper
- get it working on Vercel (lower priority since I could run this on my local laptop or Digital Ocean)
- use Retool to create a UI that allows blocking models
- Autotrader?
- make Retool mobile app

# Notes

I think as long as I:

- run it on my local computer (on a residential IP instead of in a cloud like AWS)
- don't use "headless" mode but instead have it open an actual browser window
- tell it to rely on the "userDataDir" of my real browser where I've already passed the captcha
- use https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth

it seems to work. ðŸ¤ž

It linked to https://bot.sannysoft.com/ which is a cool page.
